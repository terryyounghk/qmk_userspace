# Personal QMK userspace

**Disclaimer**

This is my personal userspace repo for QMK keyboard firmware and my journey of evolving my personal QMK keymap and keyboard preferences.

This is only tested on a RGBKB sol3, which is the keyboard I currently use.

This repo is also my first experience with the `C` programming language.

# Feature Highlights

![36-keys layout - Overview](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-overview-20230128-01.png)

| Characteristics | Support | Notes |
--------------|:-----:|---
Keys | 36 | 34-key friendly
Layers | 4 |
Base Layer | QWERTY |
Combo Mods | Yes |
Home Row Mods | Yes | Optional
Tap Dance | Yes | Optional
Combos | Yes |
Caps Word | Yes | Using Combos
One Shot Modifiers | Yes | Using Combos
One Shot Layers | Yes | Using Combos
Toggle Layer | Yes | Using Combos
Momentary Layers | Yes | Optional. Using Thumb Clusters
Audio Feedback | Yes | On layer changes

[Combo Mods](https://jasoncarloscox.com/blog/combo-mods/) are always present for both two-handed or one-handed combos.

By default, keyboard audio feedback is triggered by layer switching and toggling Caps Lock or Caps Word.

Optionally, you can enable [Home Row Mods (CAGS)](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods) and/or [tap dances](https://thomasbaart.nl/2018/12/13/qmk-basics-tap-dance/) on alpha keys.

These are disabled by default in exchange for a more responsive "Tapping Term", suitable for fast typists wanting to avoid accidentally triggering modifiers or other tap dance "hold" actions.

Edit `configs/my-options.h` to toggle audio feedback, home row mods and tap dances.

# Layers

## Base Layer

![36-keys layout - base layer](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-layer0-20230128-01.png)

## Number Layer

![36-keys layout - Number Layer](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-layer1-20230128-01.png)

## Coding Layer

![36-keys layout - Coding Layer](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-layer2-20230128-01.png)

## Controls Layer

![36-keys layout - Controls Layer](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-layer3-20230309-01.png)

While this Controls layer gives you mouse, keyboard RGB and volume controls, operations like `Undo` and `Clipboard` remains accessible with either tap dances or key combos, which can be good for things such as quick edits on draw.io.

# Combos

This firmware features several combo schemes for various purposes, as illustrated in the images below.

One-shot modifiers are provided in both one-handed or two-handed combos. (particularly good for left-handed operations while the right hand is on a mouse/trackpad)

In addition, there are more combos in `combos.def`, including words and phrases I personally use the most.

## Adjacent Key Combos

![36-keys layout - Adjacent Key Combos](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-combos-adjacent-20230128-01.png)

This combo scheme mainly features the following:

1. special characters on columns matching shifted num keys on traditional keyboards
2. common special keys on home row
3. common clipboard/undo/quit shortcuts
4. layer toggling

## Symmetric Key Combos

![36-keys layout - Symmetric Key Combos](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-combos-symmetric-20230128-01.png)

This combo scheme provides two-handed Combo Mods, which are one-shot modifiers that match the positions of home row mods, plus other common keyboard shortcuts as well.

Examples:
| Combo | Output
| ------|:---
| `A;` | `OSM(⌃)`
| `SL` | `OSM(⌥)`
| ... | ...
| `Z/` | `⌘Z`
| `X.` | `⌘X`
| ... | ...
| `BN` | `OSM(Meh)`
| `TL1 + TR1` | `Caps Lock`
| `TL2 + TR2` | `Caps Word`

One-shot mods can be chained too. For example, to perform `Cmd+Shift+S`, you can hit `DK`, then hit `FJ`, then `S`.

## One-handed Combos

![36-keys layout - One-handed Combos](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-combos-one-handed-20230128-01.png)

This combo scheme provides one-handed Combo Mods, as well as one-shot layers, toggle layers and Caps Lock/Word, all via one-handed combos on either side.

The two sides are mirrored.

One-shot modifiers can be chained, and multi-modifiers can be done in one or more shots.

For example, the following all produce the same result:

| Hit Sequence | Result | Notes
| ------|:---|---
| `TR2 + J + K + L`<br>`S` | `Cmd + Alt + Shift + S` | Hit four keys, then S
| `TR2 + J`<br>`TR2 + K`<br>`TR2 + L`<br>`S` | `Cmd + Alt + Shift + S` | Chain each modifier individual, but more hits
| `TR2 + J + K`<br>`TR2 + L`<br>`S` | `Cmd + Alt + Shift + S` | Another way to chain modifiers
| `TR2 + J + K`<br>`TR2 + J + L`<br>`S` | `Cmd + Alt + Shift + S` | Repeated mods are not cancelled, they are added

 So for example, to execute `Cmd + Shift + S` with the left hand only, hit `Spc + D`, `Spc + S` then `S` in succession.

## Key-specific Combos

![36-keys layout - Key-specific Combos Example #1](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-combos-key-specific-01-20230128-01.png)

This type of combo scheme consists of one specific key representing a particular context, plus any other key.

For example, screenshot shows combos in the context of weekdays and date related words, executed by hitting `TR1` (Right Thumb, second key) plus another key.

And for example, `TR1 + D` outputs the string `Wed`.

## More combos

Another example below shows the `ZS` combos which output short month names. Similarly, `ZD` combos output long month names.

![36-keys layout - Key-specific Combos Example #2](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-combos-key-specific-02-20230128-01.png)

There are more combos in `combos.def`, including hand swap features, plus combos  that output words and phrases I frequently use but too lazy to type over and over again...

You can also start extending your own preferences/overrides in `combos-private.def`.

# Audio Feedback

By default, audio feedback is enabled upon layer switching.

The tone of the highest active layer will be played, this applies to one-shot layers and toggled layers.

You can toggle on and off using the combos as illustrated below:

![36-keys layout - Audio Feedback](./docs/terryyounghk-36keys-qmk-combos-audio-20230128-01.png)

To disable this audio feedback feature, edit `configs/my-option.h` and comment the line with `TY_AUDIO_ENABLE`.

# Setup

Read the friendly manual from [docs.qmk.fm](https://docs.qmk.fm/) and follow their setup.

Next, assuming you are already in the `qmk_firmware` directory, grab this firmware source as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/terryyounghk/qmk_userspace.git users/terryyounghk
```

# Compiling

Assuming you are already in the `qmk_firmware/users/terryyounghk` directory:

```
qmk compile ./keymaps/sol3.json
```

Note: This firmware uses `CW_TOGG` in [Caps Word](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_caps_word), which was renamed from the previous `CAPSWRD` since 2022-11-26. Please [update your QMK set up](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_git_using_your_master_branch?id=updating-your-master-branch) to pick up this change.

# Flashing

Assuming you are already in the `qmk_firmware/users/terryyounghk` directory:

```
qmk flash ./keymaps/sol3.json
```

## Combos

When defining combos that involve multi-role keys, use the full name of the dual-role key or its tap keycode.

This is a common error.

```
const uint16_t PROGMEM A_S_COMBO[] = {KC_A, KC_S, COMBO_END}; // ❎ Incorrect
const uint16_t PROGMEM A_S_COMBO[] = {LGUI_T(KC_A), LALT_T(KC_S), COMBO_END}; // ✅ Correct
```

# How this came to be

My personal preference is to keep multiple ways of accessing layers and modifiers, particularly in one-handed and two-handed situations.

I am personally moving from Home Row Mods to Combo Mods, and this firmware can be configured for both to co-exist. Combos seem to be less intrusive when typing fast and rolling keys, and not easy to trigger by those who don't use them, so I decided to have them always present, while Home Row Mods become optional.

This firmware also demonstrates various ways to implement memorable key combo layouts that you can build upon.

Whether you want to switch from home row mods to combos mods or vice versa, or even haven't used any of them and wanted to try out both to see which suits your preference, I hope this idea serves as a good transitional keymap on your own journey of keymap customization.
